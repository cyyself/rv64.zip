# Tutorial

## CoreMark Demo

We provide a step-by-step guide on how to use the RISC-V universal binary toolchain to build optimized binaries for different hardware configurations.

We have an [demo repository](https://github.com/cyyself/rv64.zip_demo) using CoreMark to show how to use this technology to build a universal binary.
