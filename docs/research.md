# Research & Join Me

## Research

I'm currently working on a research project that involves automatic multi-version generation for binary distribution. The goal is to create a system that can automatically generate multiple versions of a binary, each optimized for different ISA extensions, not only for RISC-V but also for other architectures like aarch64 and x86-64.

Welcome to join me in this research! If you're interested in contributing or have ideas, please feel free to reach out.

## Join this project

Note that pushing this project avialable to daily use requires a lot of work, all the previous work is done only by myself and with some hints from my friends, and I would love to have more contributors to help me with this project. If you are interested in this project, please feel free to contact me. We can build a better and more efficient universal binary toolchain together!

Note that I'm a poor Ph.D. student, so I cannot pay you, but I can provide you with a good opportunity to learn and contribute to the open-source community.
