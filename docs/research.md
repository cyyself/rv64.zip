# Research

I'm currently working on a research project that involves automatic multi-version generation for binary distribution. The goal is to create a system that can automatically generate multiple versions of a binary, each optimized for different ISA extensions, not only for RISC-V but also for other architectures like aarch64 and x86-64.

Welcome to join me in this research! If you're interested in contributing or have ideas, please feel free to reach out.
